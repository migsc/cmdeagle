# cmdeagle

A versatile CLI framework that allows users to build command-line tools using JavaScript, TypeScript, and potentially other languages. It's designed to simplify the process of creating complex CLI applications by using a YAML configuration file to define commands, arguments, options, and actions.

## Installation

```sh
npm install cmdeagle
```

## Usage

1. Run `cmdeagle init` to create a new CLI project. This will create a `.cmd.yaml` file in your project root to define your CLI structure.

3. Build your CLI:

```sh
cmdeagle build
```

4. Run your CLI:

Linux:

```sh
cd && /.local/bin/mycli hello 
```
